              The whole process was made easier with the personal
              attention paid by Elena and her staff. We anticipated a
              nerve racking experience but it turned out to be much
              smoother than we expected. I'm happy to recommend Elena Steers.

            <p>"I'm a single parent who was struggling to keep my house and
            to take care of my kids. Extra bills from a medical emergency
            forced me deep into debt and a foreclosure sale on the home.
            Two weeks before the planned sale I met with Elena, and got her
            advice on my options. We ended up saving the house, paying just
            a small fraction of the remaining medical bills and credit card
            bills, and will be able to drop the second mortgage entirely."</p>

            <p>"My bank would not work with me on lowering my home loan no matter
            what I presented to them. My wife then lost her job, in time we starting
            surviving on credit cards. Finally we received a notice of a foreclosure
            sale, the worst day of my life. Desperate for help we saw several lawyers;
            Elena Steers clearly was the most helpful and understanding. We stopped the
            foreclosure sale and we're on a low cost plan to pay off the rest of our
            bills over five years. I'll add here that we now have a close family member
            and a friend with a small business also working with Elena."</p>

            <p>"My financial situation had gone from bad to worse within six months.
            First we were trying for a loan modification. It required that we be behind
            with the mortgage payments...no problem, we were already at that point anyway.
            Then there was a 'trial period' where we made adjusted lower monthly payments,
            but to our surprise the loan was not approved. We were then notified that we
            had to come up with the difference between what we had been paying during the
            "trial period" and what the original monthly loan payment had been...this pushed
            us to the brink. Then we found attorney Elena Steers, who was recommended by a
            friend. She clearly laid out our options. We saved our house, got rid of the
            creditcard debt and we'll also be getting rid of our second mortgage. Relief
            beyond measure."</p>
